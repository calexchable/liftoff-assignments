# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview

GetSauced is an app that allows users to describe and rate their favorite hot sauces. But because users will have different "tolerances" for spiciness, this app contains a function that can predict how a user might rate the heat of a sauce they search.

### Features

* User Login: Users will be able to create an account to track their selections and posts.
* Searchable Blog Posts: Users will be able to search for an index of sauces and compare their comments with other users.
* Manage Blog Posts: Users will be able to create, edit, remove posts.
* Rating Systems: Users will be able to use to rating systems. One for taste (how much a person enjoys a particular sauce). And a second rating to measure a user's perspective of the spiciness of the sauce.
* Comparative Rating: A suggested rating that will predict what a user might rate a hot sauce that they have not tried.

### Technologies

Written with IntelliJ
* JavaScrypt
* MySQL
* Html
* BootStrap

### What I'll Have to Learn

In the course of this project I will focus more on honing skills in the fields and programming languages worked on during the LaunchCode Program.

In the backend, I am excited to figure out the way to compare and predict information for a Comparative Rating system.

In addition to the backend, I am excited to work on front-end design. I've felt that in these months I have been so focused on back end and put front end design on the "back burner".
